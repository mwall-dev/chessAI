Python chess AI vs human player.

    
    - Start with human vs human or do human vs computer with random moves 
      with moves printed to command line.
      Use flask and display board. Add a text box and a button to submit move through chess notation.

    - Then with moves printed to web app GUI, use flask and look at geohot quick implementation
    with button to submit moves vs computer doing random moves.

    - (Java script maybe) Get board and GUI working with basic move logic and turn switiching.



    Optimisations:
      - Caching for FEN strings in a map with key, val = fen and other info, valuation.
      Have a seperate cache for minimising and maximising players.
